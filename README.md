## BTorrent


### What is this?

This is a [chrome extension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome_extension) to enable search and download of torrents. This works by integrating with the web API of the transmission daemon and by using a [backend service](https://github.com/Balhau/WebPtData), running [here](http://webpt.balhau.net/), that is responsible to retrieve the results of the query


### Transmission Daemon setup

If you got your transmission-daemon setup with this plugin you can go to options menu and insert your credentials

here I advise you to use https if possible.


### [YTS.ag](https://yts.ag/) integration

The plugin has suport for YTS. This means that if you click on the icon that represents the torrent files you'll add the torrent directly into your transmission-daemon download list.

### Search mechanism

The search mechanism will, in the future, allow to search for a torrent pattern and group all the results
